## eye gaze position decoding

Eyetracking results included in this manuscript
come from preprocessing
performed using [*bidsMReye*](https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/bidsMReye) (version {{version}}),
a BIDS app relying on [deepMReye](https://github.com/DeepMReye/DeepMReye) (@deepmreye)
to decode eye motion from fMRI time series data.

### data extraction

The data of each BOLD runs underwent co-registration conducted
using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs, RRID:SCR_004757) within Python (ANTsPy).
First, each participant's mean EPI was non-linearly co-registered
to an average template.
Second, all voxels within a bounding box that included the eyes
were co-registered to a preselected bounding box in our group template to further improve the fit.

Each voxel within those bounding box underwent two normalization steps.
First, the across-run median signal intensity was subtracted
from each voxel and sample
and was divided by the median absolute deviation over time (temporal normalization).
Second, for each sample, the mean across all voxels
within the eye masks was subtracted and divided by the standard deviation
across voxels (spatial normalization).

### decoding

Voxels time series were used as inputs for generalization decoding
using a
    {% if is_known_model %}
pre-trained model {{ model }} from deepMReye from [OSF](https://osf.io/23t5v).
        {% if is_default_model %}
This model was trained on the following datasets:
guided fixations (@alexander_open_2017),
smooth pursuit (@nau_real-motion_2018, @polti_rapid_2022, @nau_hexadirectional_2018),
free viewing (@julian_human_2018).
        {% endif %}

model trained on calibration data from the current study.
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

### quality control

For each run the following values were computed:
- the variance for the X gaze position
- the variance for the Y gaze position
- the framewise gaze displacement
- the number of outliers for the X gaze position
- the number of outliers for the Y gaze position
- the number of outliers for the gaze displacement

Outliers were robustely estimated using an implementation of @carling_resistant_2000.
