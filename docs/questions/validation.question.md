bidsmreye requires your input fmri data:

 - to be minimally preprocessed
 - with filenames and structure that conforms to a BIDS derivative dataset.

Two bids apps are available to generate those types of preprocessed data:

- [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/)
- [bidspm](https://bidspm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general_information.html)
